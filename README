README

Welcome to the Open Bank Project Social Finance / Transparency Web Application!

ABOUT

This appliation demostrates some of the principles of the Open Bank Project:

1) Sliding scale of privacy and disclosure. e.g. Use aliases to protect real names but still show the flow of money .
2) Different views on account data (Public / Share holders / Team etc.) e.g. hide balances on public view.
3) Comment on transactions
4) Add other meta data e.g. tags / images to transactions / payees.

SETUP

The project is using sbt or Maven 2 as a build tool.
See build.scala or pom.xml respectively for the dependencies.

----

To compile and run jetty, cd into the root directory (where this file is) and run:

$ sbt
...
> compile
> ~;container:start; container:reload /

(Note that you first have to start sbt and then on its console start jetty with the container:start task, otherwise it will exit immediately. More here: https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin/wiki)

In OS X, sbt can be installed with $ sudo port install sbt

----


Alternatively, maven can also be used:

mvn jetty:run


Note: You may need to add the pluginGroup to the $HOME/.m2/settings.xml

<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  ...
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>org.mortbay.jetty</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>
  ...
</settings>

You need to install MongoDB and create an empty database called "OBP006".
