				Welcome to The Open Bank Project’s Social Finance web application.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				The Social Finance application (a.k.a. Transparency application) allows
				bank account holders to choose with whom they would like to share their
				transaction data. For instance, an individual might share their bank
				account with their accountant; a company with their directors and/or
				shareholders; an NGO or government department with the public.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Account holders can preserve privacy and commercial confidentiality 
				by using aliases to protect the real names.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				We enable a lively dialogue around the transactions which may be
				annotated with comments and images. For instance an NGO could upload
				pictures of a building which cost €50,000 and members of the public can
				comment on the value and quality of the work.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>	
				Once connected, account holders can also benefit from other applications
				that use the Open Bank Project API e.g. the <a href="http://www.singingbank.com" title="Singing bank App"> Singing Bank</a>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				See the left panel for examples of organisations raising the bar of
				financial transparency !
